Python is a programming language. 
Its a language we use to write programs. 
"A program is a set of instructions that tells a computer how to do something". 
We canâ€™t use a "proper" language like English to do this because "proper English" is just too confusing for a computer to understand.

Ex: Drink water only after you had your meal

For a human its understood that first he has to complete his meal then drink water.

For a computer to make it understand we need to write instruction in the order we want it to follow, for above example:
   Step1: Complete food
   Step2: Drink water
